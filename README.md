# tex-apa
This is a LaTeX class that mimics the official APA 2010 style. Simply include the ```.cls``` file in your folder, and look at my ```apa_test.tex``` template to see how it works (it's easy, I promise!). For any issues with LaTeX google is a great resource, the only thing I have to add is that the ```\citeA``` command is added by the package that make the citations APA-style. The result is that the author is referenced automatically with the year(/and page) bracketed behind it.

I will include two styles, based on the 2010 manual. Both are the same in terms of the fields you can fill in (Author etc.), but the header style and cover page is slightly different. I entered the standard fields for a paper for a course, plus an additional field for how the work was divided, or the wordcount, or whatever you need. It can be as many lines as you want, just use ```\break``` to get a new line in that field!

# Support

You probably know how to use LaTeX if you use this, but if you have any questions just enter it in the issues-category on the GitHub repository (where you downloaded it from). I can totally imagine something breaks, since the class file is not the most organized thing ever.
